> Site to actively look for active streams at UiA.


# What
Meant as an inhouse tool for https://www.uia.no/om-uia/media/it-avdelingens-mediesenter. (Grimstad)
Where they can monitor multiple streams running at the same time at UiA Grimstad.
- Where it will show all streams and adjust the grid as new one come and go.
- It should show the Title of the course somewhere near the video strem "view"
- It should have a seperate VU metere to "visually" see the audio comming out from the stream
- It should also have the option to hear audio from all streams at the same time, or just solo Selective streams with a somewhat neat controll panel.
  
# Why
- So one don't have to have n-laptops running to follow all the streams running.
